# hello-world
My first steps back into coding. Hello World!

My name is Simone Kamer. 
After years of working as a speech-language pathologist and not being very active in the field of coding,
it is time for me to see what knowledge from my first year at the university has stuck.
I hereby proudly present myself..

I'm BACK!
