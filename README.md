# hello-world
My first steps back into coding. Hello World!

My name is Simone Kamer. 
After years of working as a speech-language pathologist and not being very active in the field of coding,
it is time for me to see what knowledge from my first year at the university has stuck.
And to develop myself with every new bit of code.
I hereby proudly present myself..

I'm BACK! (and here to stay)
